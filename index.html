        <p class="lead mb-4">I began my university career in high school by enrolling in dual enrollment courses offered by Riverside City College, receiving both high school and university credits simultaneously. Enrolling in these dual enrollment courses allowed me to receive my Associateâ€™s for Transfer in one year demonstrating my accelerated pathway.  I am currently a junior at the University of California, Riverside, and in the process of completing my Bachelor of Arts in political science. I plan on furthering my education with a postgraduate degree by attending law school in the future to receive my Juris Doctor allowing for a career pathway in law.<br><br>

        My legal experience is highlighted by my time at the Law Office of Daniel Crgnelutti where I worked as a law clerk. In this role, I accomplished and undertook various legal tasks and responsibilities. Drafted a variety of legal documents by utilizing critical thinking and problem-solving skills while following appropriate procedures, ensuring client interests are protected. Communicated with clients regarding conflicts in their cases by scheduling appointments and providing the necessary course of action to ensure a positive resolution resulting in client satisfaction. Stocked and sorted client files in an organized manner, increasing productivity and optimizing efficiency. Collaborated with colleagues and lawyers in tackling various legal issues by conferring numerous resolutions securing and protecting client interests. Utilized computer software to monitor and file various documents, ensuring an organized system.<br><br>

        As a warehouse trainer, my primary responsibility was to ensure that new employees were properly trained to perform their duties efficiently and safely. This involved developing and implementing training programs that covered various aspects of warehouse operations, including equipment operation, inventory management, and safety protocols. I was responsible for conducting training sessions for new hires, as well as providing ongoing support and guidance to help them succeed in their roles. This included both classroom-style instruction and hands-on training in the warehouse environment. In addition to training new employees, I also played a role in developing and updating training materials and procedures to ensure that they remained up-to-date and effective. This involved working closely with management and other team members to identify areas for improvement and implement changes as needed. Another important aspect of my role as a warehouse trainer was to ensure that all employees were following safety protocols and procedures at all times. This involved conducting regular safety inspections, identifying potential hazards, and taking corrective action to mitigate risks. In addition to training new employees, I was also responsible for providing refresher training to existing staff as needed, ensuring that everyone remained up-to-date on the latest procedures and best practices. This involved identifying areas where additional training was needed and working with individual employees to address any gaps in their knowledge or skills. Furthermore, I played a key role in monitoring the progress of trainees, providing feedback and support to help them improve their performance and reach their full potential within the warehouse environment. Overall, my experience as a warehouse trainer involved a diverse range of responsibilities aimed at promoting efficiency, safety, and success within the warehouse operation.
